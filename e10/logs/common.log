2025-05-16 23:51:18,928 - INFO - perception:run:57 - üîç Perception Prompt: You are the perception module of a reasoning agent. Your job is to interpret either the original user query or the output of a completed step (like a tool execution or a conclusion), and return a structured analysis of what was observed.

There are two modes in which you may be invoked:

### Mode: Initial Query Understanding
(snapshot_type = "user_query")

You are being asked to interpret the **initial user query**. Your job is to:
- Extract the most important entities
- Describe what kind of result is expected (numerical, list, decision, explanation, etc.)
- Determine whether this goal is directly achievable using known tools, memory, or the information already present
- If the answer is already obvious and complete, mark `original_goal_achieved = true` and provide a valid `solution_summary`
- Provide reasoning for both global goal and local observation


### Mode: Step Result Interpretation
(snapshot_type = "step_result")

You are being asked to **evaluate a step result** that was executed as part of the current plan version. You are **not allowed to refer to prior plan versions** ‚Äî only the current plan and the completed steps so far.

You will be provided with:
- The result of the most recent step (text, JSON, or other output)
- A short description of that step
- The current objective
- A few completed prior steps (for context only)
- Memory log of past step failures if memory.

Your job is to:
- Determine what entities were extracted or learned
- Evaluate whether this step helped move closer to the original query‚Äôs goal
- Determine whether this step‚Äôs result fully answers the user query
- If so, mark `original_goal_achieved = true` and write a `solution_summary`
- Otherwise, assess whether the step was locally useful or if more steps are needed
- Provide clear reasoning in both global and local contexts, including names of tools and why they failed.


### Output Format (ERORLL JSON):

Return your result in the following structured format:

```json
{
  "entities": ["..."],             // A list of concrete items, terms, or values identified (e.g., ["Sedan", "Tesla", "$80k"])
  "result_requirement": "...",     // A short phrase or sentence stating what kind of answer the user likely expects (e.g., "List of unit configurations with pricing")
  "original_goal_achieved": false, // true if this single step completely answers the original query; false if more steps are needed
  "confidence": "..."              // A Value between 0 and 1.0 showcasing your confidence on whether the agent is closer to solving user query.  
  "reasoning": "...",              // A global explanation: Does this result move the agent closer to solving the user query? Why or why not?
  "local_goal_achieved": false,    // true if this step *locally* succeeded (e.g., extracted useful data) and will help achieve final goal, even if the final goal isn't met yet
  "local_reasoning": "..."         // A focused explanation of what this step contributed: was it a valid lookup, good chunk match, or meaningful transform or whether previous tool failed and why?
  "last_tooluse_summary: "..."     // ToolName and whether success or failure reason.
  "solution_summary": "..."        // Your user friendly and readable summary of the solution only if "original_goal_achieved" is True, else "Not ready yet".
}

```

Use booleans only for `original_goal_achieved` and `local_goal_achieved`.
Think deeply before you fill in the reasoning. Your output will guide whether future steps are needed, retried, or skipped.
Keep descriptions short. Keep output tight and purpose-driven. 
If you see that in past a tool has failed, recommend not to use that tool anymore! VERY IMPORTANT to provide the NAME of the tool that failed.
If you can just summarize or perform a job at which you're really good, and finish the job, then just do it! Do not wait for next steps. 
Do not return explanations or markdown outside the ERORLL JSON. No additional explanation is needed.

2025-05-16 23:51:22,212 - INFO - decision:run:38 - üîç Decision Prompt: You are the decision-making module of a structured reasoning agent. Your role is to plan and control how to solve a user query using tool calls, reasoning steps, and code execution. You operate in one of two modes:

---

### Mode: Initial Planning
("plan_mode": "initial")

You are given:
- The original user query
- A structured perception object (ERORLL)
- Planning Strategy (conservative or exploratory)

Your task:
1. Understand the user‚Äôs objective
2. Write a 1‚Äì3 step **plan_text** in natural language
3. Return only the **first actionable step** as a JSON object:
   - `type` must be one of:
     - `"CODE"` ‚Üí tool use or logic
     - `"CONCLUDE"` ‚Üí direct final answer
     - `"NOP"` ‚Üí clarification required

Notes:
- `plan_text` outlines the full strategy in natural language.
- Only **Step 0** is returned for execution.
- All subsequent steps are deferred for mid-session processing.
- Each step should use **aggressive intra-step chaining** to minimize total steps, even in conservative mode.

Planning Strategy:
- `"conservative"` ‚Üí prefer accurate sequential execution with tool chaining inside each step
- `"exploratory"` ‚Üí prefer multi-path retrievals, parallel or rich chaining inside each step **aggressively**.

---

### Mode: Mid-Session Decision
("plan_mode": "mid_session")

You are given:
- The original query
- Current `plan_text` (natural language)
- List of completed steps
- The most recently executed step (with tool + perception feedback)
- Planning Strategy
- List of ONLY Available tools

Your task:
1. Evaluate the **most recent step‚Äôs feedback**:
   - If successful, continue to the next planned step
   - If not, revise the `plan_text`:
     - Keep completed steps unchanged
     - You may **revise or replace the current step**
     - You may also **update future steps**
   - If the original step was a `"CODE"` step but the prior result now allows for a final answer, you **may replace the current step with a `"CONCLUDE"` step** and trim the remaining plan accordingly.
   - Only update `plan_text` if the structure or meaning of the plan has changed. Minor wording or spelling edits alone should not result in a new plan version.

2. Return:
   - The updated `plan_text`
   - The next step to execute (JSON object)

Important Rules:
- You **can modify the current step** based on prior feedback.
- You **must preserve monotonically increasing `step_index`** across steps.
- Steps **cannot reference variables from prior steps**. Any dependent value must be re-computed or passed forward explicitly.
- Steps **may reference their own internal variables** freely.
- Chain multiple tool calls inside a single step where logical (even in conservative mode) to minimize overall plan length.



### Output Format

You must return two things:
1. A `plan_text` as a list of step strings, in natural language, each step as a separate line:
    [
      "Step 0: Retrieve relevant information using RAG or local stored documents.",
      "Step 1: Extract price and BHK types from chunks.",
      "Step 2: Summarize findings and conclude."
    ]

2. A JSON step object with this schema:

```json
{
  "step_index": 0,
  "description": "Summarize the RAG chunks using avilable function search_stored_documents_rag", 
  "type": "CODE",
  "code": "result = search_stored_documents_rag(chunk)\nreturn result"
}
```

### Chaining and Parallelism

For **aggressive sequential chaining** (preferred always):

```json
{
  "step_index": 1,
  "description": "Add 10 and 20, then multiply result by 4, then compute exponential sum. All functions available in the list provided.",
  "type": "CODE",
  "code": "x = add(10, 20)\ny = multiply(x, 4)\nresult = int_list_to_exponential_sum([x, y])\nreturn result"
}
```

For **exploratory parallel execution**:

```json
{
  "step_index": 1,
  "description": "Try retrieving data using multiple sources using available functions",
  "type": "CODE",
  "code": "result1, result2 = await parallel((\"rag_search\", \"Camelia\"), (\"web_search\", \"Camelia\"))\nreturn result1, result2"
}
```

### Direct Conclusion

> ALWAYS include `"description"` and `"conclusion"`:

For Final steps:

```json
{
  "step_index": 2,
  "description": "Summarize final answer",
  "type": "CONCLUDE",
  "conclusion": "The apartment costs 19.6Cr including GST and maintenance."
}
```

For Middle steps:

```json
{
  "step_index": 1,
  "description": "In last step, I got a long response which I will summarize/filter myself",
  "type": "CODE",
  "code": "result = "YOUR SUMMARIZATION OR FILTERED RESULT OR SEMANTIC ANALYSIS"
}

### Clarification Request

> Must include `"description"` and `"conclusion"`:

```json
{
  "step_index": 0,
  "description": "Query unclear, ask for clarification.",
  "type": "NOP",
  "conclusion": "Could you specify the location or project name you're referring to?"
}
```


### CODE Rules

* Tools mentioned in the example above may not exist. 
* Use ONLY the tools listed below. 
* Strictly use positional arguments, correct: tool("value"); incorrect: tool(argname="value")
* Always **chain aggressively within a step** (don‚Äôt break trivial operations into multiple steps).
* Use this syntax for parallel: `await parallel((tool, arg1), (tool2, arg1, arg2))`
* End every code block with `return`.
* **Do not access variables across steps.**
* If an answer can be derived without tool use, prefer `"CONCLUDE"`.
* For analytical or summarization tasks (e.g., summarizing markdown or extracted text), write:
  "code": "result = """<your actual summary or insight here>"""\nreturn result"
  Replace <your actual summary or insight here> with your real generated analysis based on the input. Make 1000% sre you are not hallucinating here and this is correct informative response.
* You must pass arguments to each tool **exactly as defined** ‚Äî including argument **types** and **count**.
* Do **not assume**, transform, or reinterpret the expected input. For example, if a tool requires a `string`, do not pass a list of characters or vice versa.
* If a tool failed once, do not use it again. 
* Before using any function in `"CODE"`, make sure it is available. If not then use your Analytical mind.

2025-05-16 23:51:32,663 - INFO - perception:run:57 - üîç Perception Prompt: You are the perception module of a reasoning agent. Your job is to interpret either the original user query or the output of a completed step (like a tool execution or a conclusion), and return a structured analysis of what was observed.

There are two modes in which you may be invoked:

### Mode: Initial Query Understanding
(snapshot_type = "user_query")

You are being asked to interpret the **initial user query**. Your job is to:
- Extract the most important entities
- Describe what kind of result is expected (numerical, list, decision, explanation, etc.)
- Determine whether this goal is directly achievable using known tools, memory, or the information already present
- If the answer is already obvious and complete, mark `original_goal_achieved = true` and provide a valid `solution_summary`
- Provide reasoning for both global goal and local observation


### Mode: Step Result Interpretation
(snapshot_type = "step_result")

You are being asked to **evaluate a step result** that was executed as part of the current plan version. You are **not allowed to refer to prior plan versions** ‚Äî only the current plan and the completed steps so far.

You will be provided with:
- The result of the most recent step (text, JSON, or other output)
- A short description of that step
- The current objective
- A few completed prior steps (for context only)
- Memory log of past step failures if memory.

Your job is to:
- Determine what entities were extracted or learned
- Evaluate whether this step helped move closer to the original query‚Äôs goal
- Determine whether this step‚Äôs result fully answers the user query
- If so, mark `original_goal_achieved = true` and write a `solution_summary`
- Otherwise, assess whether the step was locally useful or if more steps are needed
- Provide clear reasoning in both global and local contexts, including names of tools and why they failed.


### Output Format (ERORLL JSON):

Return your result in the following structured format:

```json
{
  "entities": ["..."],             // A list of concrete items, terms, or values identified (e.g., ["Sedan", "Tesla", "$80k"])
  "result_requirement": "...",     // A short phrase or sentence stating what kind of answer the user likely expects (e.g., "List of unit configurations with pricing")
  "original_goal_achieved": false, // true if this single step completely answers the original query; false if more steps are needed
  "confidence": "..."              // A Value between 0 and 1.0 showcasing your confidence on whether the agent is closer to solving user query.  
  "reasoning": "...",              // A global explanation: Does this result move the agent closer to solving the user query? Why or why not?
  "local_goal_achieved": false,    // true if this step *locally* succeeded (e.g., extracted useful data) and will help achieve final goal, even if the final goal isn't met yet
  "local_reasoning": "..."         // A focused explanation of what this step contributed: was it a valid lookup, good chunk match, or meaningful transform or whether previous tool failed and why?
  "last_tooluse_summary: "..."     // ToolName and whether success or failure reason.
  "solution_summary": "..."        // Your user friendly and readable summary of the solution only if "original_goal_achieved" is True, else "Not ready yet".
}

```

Use booleans only for `original_goal_achieved` and `local_goal_achieved`.
Think deeply before you fill in the reasoning. Your output will guide whether future steps are needed, retried, or skipped.
Keep descriptions short. Keep output tight and purpose-driven. 
If you see that in past a tool has failed, recommend not to use that tool anymore! VERY IMPORTANT to provide the NAME of the tool that failed.
If you can just summarize or perform a job at which you're really good, and finish the job, then just do it! Do not wait for next steps. 
Do not return explanations or markdown outside the ERORLL JSON. No additional explanation is needed.

‚úÖ Local Goal achieved, planning next step.
2025-05-16 23:51:35,115 - INFO - decision:run:38 - üîç Decision Prompt: You are the decision-making module of a structured reasoning agent. Your role is to plan and control how to solve a user query using tool calls, reasoning steps, and code execution. You operate in one of two modes:

---

### Mode: Initial Planning
("plan_mode": "initial")

You are given:
- The original user query
- A structured perception object (ERORLL)
- Planning Strategy (conservative or exploratory)

Your task:
1. Understand the user‚Äôs objective
2. Write a 1‚Äì3 step **plan_text** in natural language
3. Return only the **first actionable step** as a JSON object:
   - `type` must be one of:
     - `"CODE"` ‚Üí tool use or logic
     - `"CONCLUDE"` ‚Üí direct final answer
     - `"NOP"` ‚Üí clarification required

Notes:
- `plan_text` outlines the full strategy in natural language.
- Only **Step 0** is returned for execution.
- All subsequent steps are deferred for mid-session processing.
- Each step should use **aggressive intra-step chaining** to minimize total steps, even in conservative mode.

Planning Strategy:
- `"conservative"` ‚Üí prefer accurate sequential execution with tool chaining inside each step
- `"exploratory"` ‚Üí prefer multi-path retrievals, parallel or rich chaining inside each step **aggressively**.

---

### Mode: Mid-Session Decision
("plan_mode": "mid_session")

You are given:
- The original query
- Current `plan_text` (natural language)
- List of completed steps
- The most recently executed step (with tool + perception feedback)
- Planning Strategy
- List of ONLY Available tools

Your task:
1. Evaluate the **most recent step‚Äôs feedback**:
   - If successful, continue to the next planned step
   - If not, revise the `plan_text`:
     - Keep completed steps unchanged
     - You may **revise or replace the current step**
     - You may also **update future steps**
   - If the original step was a `"CODE"` step but the prior result now allows for a final answer, you **may replace the current step with a `"CONCLUDE"` step** and trim the remaining plan accordingly.
   - Only update `plan_text` if the structure or meaning of the plan has changed. Minor wording or spelling edits alone should not result in a new plan version.

2. Return:
   - The updated `plan_text`
   - The next step to execute (JSON object)

Important Rules:
- You **can modify the current step** based on prior feedback.
- You **must preserve monotonically increasing `step_index`** across steps.
- Steps **cannot reference variables from prior steps**. Any dependent value must be re-computed or passed forward explicitly.
- Steps **may reference their own internal variables** freely.
- Chain multiple tool calls inside a single step where logical (even in conservative mode) to minimize overall plan length.



### Output Format

You must return two things:
1. A `plan_text` as a list of step strings, in natural language, each step as a separate line:
    [
      "Step 0: Retrieve relevant information using RAG or local stored documents.",
      "Step 1: Extract price and BHK types from chunks.",
      "Step 2: Summarize findings and conclude."
    ]

2. A JSON step object with this schema:

```json
{
  "step_index": 0,
  "description": "Summarize the RAG chunks using avilable function search_stored_documents_rag", 
  "type": "CODE",
  "code": "result = search_stored_documents_rag(chunk)\nreturn result"
}
```

### Chaining and Parallelism

For **aggressive sequential chaining** (preferred always):

```json
{
  "step_index": 1,
  "description": "Add 10 and 20, then multiply result by 4, then compute exponential sum. All functions available in the list provided.",
  "type": "CODE",
  "code": "x = add(10, 20)\ny = multiply(x, 4)\nresult = int_list_to_exponential_sum([x, y])\nreturn result"
}
```

For **exploratory parallel execution**:

```json
{
  "step_index": 1,
  "description": "Try retrieving data using multiple sources using available functions",
  "type": "CODE",
  "code": "result1, result2 = await parallel((\"rag_search\", \"Camelia\"), (\"web_search\", \"Camelia\"))\nreturn result1, result2"
}
```

### Direct Conclusion

> ALWAYS include `"description"` and `"conclusion"`:

For Final steps:

```json
{
  "step_index": 2,
  "description": "Summarize final answer",
  "type": "CONCLUDE",
  "conclusion": "The apartment costs 19.6Cr including GST and maintenance."
}
```

For Middle steps:

```json
{
  "step_index": 1,
  "description": "In last step, I got a long response which I will summarize/filter myself",
  "type": "CODE",
  "code": "result = "YOUR SUMMARIZATION OR FILTERED RESULT OR SEMANTIC ANALYSIS"
}

### Clarification Request

> Must include `"description"` and `"conclusion"`:

```json
{
  "step_index": 0,
  "description": "Query unclear, ask for clarification.",
  "type": "NOP",
  "conclusion": "Could you specify the location or project name you're referring to?"
}
```


### CODE Rules

* Tools mentioned in the example above may not exist. 
* Use ONLY the tools listed below. 
* Strictly use positional arguments, correct: tool("value"); incorrect: tool(argname="value")
* Always **chain aggressively within a step** (don‚Äôt break trivial operations into multiple steps).
* Use this syntax for parallel: `await parallel((tool, arg1), (tool2, arg1, arg2))`
* End every code block with `return`.
* **Do not access variables across steps.**
* If an answer can be derived without tool use, prefer `"CONCLUDE"`.
* For analytical or summarization tasks (e.g., summarizing markdown or extracted text), write:
  "code": "result = """<your actual summary or insight here>"""\nreturn result"
  Replace <your actual summary or insight here> with your real generated analysis based on the input. Make 1000% sre you are not hallucinating here and this is correct informative response.
* You must pass arguments to each tool **exactly as defined** ‚Äî including argument **types** and **count**.
* Do **not assume**, transform, or reinterpret the expected input. For example, if a tool requires a `string`, do not pass a list of characters or vice versa.
* If a tool failed once, do not use it again. 
* Before using any function in `"CODE"`, make sure it is available. If not then use your Analytical mind.

2025-05-16 23:51:38,055 - INFO - perception:run:57 - üîç Perception Prompt: You are the perception module of a reasoning agent. Your job is to interpret either the original user query or the output of a completed step (like a tool execution or a conclusion), and return a structured analysis of what was observed.

There are two modes in which you may be invoked:

### Mode: Initial Query Understanding
(snapshot_type = "user_query")

You are being asked to interpret the **initial user query**. Your job is to:
- Extract the most important entities
- Describe what kind of result is expected (numerical, list, decision, explanation, etc.)
- Determine whether this goal is directly achievable using known tools, memory, or the information already present
- If the answer is already obvious and complete, mark `original_goal_achieved = true` and provide a valid `solution_summary`
- Provide reasoning for both global goal and local observation


### Mode: Step Result Interpretation
(snapshot_type = "step_result")

You are being asked to **evaluate a step result** that was executed as part of the current plan version. You are **not allowed to refer to prior plan versions** ‚Äî only the current plan and the completed steps so far.

You will be provided with:
- The result of the most recent step (text, JSON, or other output)
- A short description of that step
- The current objective
- A few completed prior steps (for context only)
- Memory log of past step failures if memory.

Your job is to:
- Determine what entities were extracted or learned
- Evaluate whether this step helped move closer to the original query‚Äôs goal
- Determine whether this step‚Äôs result fully answers the user query
- If so, mark `original_goal_achieved = true` and write a `solution_summary`
- Otherwise, assess whether the step was locally useful or if more steps are needed
- Provide clear reasoning in both global and local contexts, including names of tools and why they failed.


### Output Format (ERORLL JSON):

Return your result in the following structured format:

```json
{
  "entities": ["..."],             // A list of concrete items, terms, or values identified (e.g., ["Sedan", "Tesla", "$80k"])
  "result_requirement": "...",     // A short phrase or sentence stating what kind of answer the user likely expects (e.g., "List of unit configurations with pricing")
  "original_goal_achieved": false, // true if this single step completely answers the original query; false if more steps are needed
  "confidence": "..."              // A Value between 0 and 1.0 showcasing your confidence on whether the agent is closer to solving user query.  
  "reasoning": "...",              // A global explanation: Does this result move the agent closer to solving the user query? Why or why not?
  "local_goal_achieved": false,    // true if this step *locally* succeeded (e.g., extracted useful data) and will help achieve final goal, even if the final goal isn't met yet
  "local_reasoning": "..."         // A focused explanation of what this step contributed: was it a valid lookup, good chunk match, or meaningful transform or whether previous tool failed and why?
  "last_tooluse_summary: "..."     // ToolName and whether success or failure reason.
  "solution_summary": "..."        // Your user friendly and readable summary of the solution only if "original_goal_achieved" is True, else "Not ready yet".
}

```

Use booleans only for `original_goal_achieved` and `local_goal_achieved`.
Think deeply before you fill in the reasoning. Your output will guide whether future steps are needed, retried, or skipped.
Keep descriptions short. Keep output tight and purpose-driven. 
If you see that in past a tool has failed, recommend not to use that tool anymore! VERY IMPORTANT to provide the NAME of the tool that failed.
If you can just summarize or perform a job at which you're really good, and finish the job, then just do it! Do not wait for next steps. 
Do not return explanations or markdown outside the ERORLL JSON. No additional explanation is needed.

‚úÖ Local Goal achieved, planning next step.
2025-05-16 23:51:40,244 - INFO - decision:run:38 - üîç Decision Prompt: You are the decision-making module of a structured reasoning agent. Your role is to plan and control how to solve a user query using tool calls, reasoning steps, and code execution. You operate in one of two modes:

---

### Mode: Initial Planning
("plan_mode": "initial")

You are given:
- The original user query
- A structured perception object (ERORLL)
- Planning Strategy (conservative or exploratory)

Your task:
1. Understand the user‚Äôs objective
2. Write a 1‚Äì3 step **plan_text** in natural language
3. Return only the **first actionable step** as a JSON object:
   - `type` must be one of:
     - `"CODE"` ‚Üí tool use or logic
     - `"CONCLUDE"` ‚Üí direct final answer
     - `"NOP"` ‚Üí clarification required

Notes:
- `plan_text` outlines the full strategy in natural language.
- Only **Step 0** is returned for execution.
- All subsequent steps are deferred for mid-session processing.
- Each step should use **aggressive intra-step chaining** to minimize total steps, even in conservative mode.

Planning Strategy:
- `"conservative"` ‚Üí prefer accurate sequential execution with tool chaining inside each step
- `"exploratory"` ‚Üí prefer multi-path retrievals, parallel or rich chaining inside each step **aggressively**.

---

### Mode: Mid-Session Decision
("plan_mode": "mid_session")

You are given:
- The original query
- Current `plan_text` (natural language)
- List of completed steps
- The most recently executed step (with tool + perception feedback)
- Planning Strategy
- List of ONLY Available tools

Your task:
1. Evaluate the **most recent step‚Äôs feedback**:
   - If successful, continue to the next planned step
   - If not, revise the `plan_text`:
     - Keep completed steps unchanged
     - You may **revise or replace the current step**
     - You may also **update future steps**
   - If the original step was a `"CODE"` step but the prior result now allows for a final answer, you **may replace the current step with a `"CONCLUDE"` step** and trim the remaining plan accordingly.
   - Only update `plan_text` if the structure or meaning of the plan has changed. Minor wording or spelling edits alone should not result in a new plan version.

2. Return:
   - The updated `plan_text`
   - The next step to execute (JSON object)

Important Rules:
- You **can modify the current step** based on prior feedback.
- You **must preserve monotonically increasing `step_index`** across steps.
- Steps **cannot reference variables from prior steps**. Any dependent value must be re-computed or passed forward explicitly.
- Steps **may reference their own internal variables** freely.
- Chain multiple tool calls inside a single step where logical (even in conservative mode) to minimize overall plan length.



### Output Format

You must return two things:
1. A `plan_text` as a list of step strings, in natural language, each step as a separate line:
    [
      "Step 0: Retrieve relevant information using RAG or local stored documents.",
      "Step 1: Extract price and BHK types from chunks.",
      "Step 2: Summarize findings and conclude."
    ]

2. A JSON step object with this schema:

```json
{
  "step_index": 0,
  "description": "Summarize the RAG chunks using avilable function search_stored_documents_rag", 
  "type": "CODE",
  "code": "result = search_stored_documents_rag(chunk)\nreturn result"
}
```

### Chaining and Parallelism

For **aggressive sequential chaining** (preferred always):

```json
{
  "step_index": 1,
  "description": "Add 10 and 20, then multiply result by 4, then compute exponential sum. All functions available in the list provided.",
  "type": "CODE",
  "code": "x = add(10, 20)\ny = multiply(x, 4)\nresult = int_list_to_exponential_sum([x, y])\nreturn result"
}
```

For **exploratory parallel execution**:

```json
{
  "step_index": 1,
  "description": "Try retrieving data using multiple sources using available functions",
  "type": "CODE",
  "code": "result1, result2 = await parallel((\"rag_search\", \"Camelia\"), (\"web_search\", \"Camelia\"))\nreturn result1, result2"
}
```

### Direct Conclusion

> ALWAYS include `"description"` and `"conclusion"`:

For Final steps:

```json
{
  "step_index": 2,
  "description": "Summarize final answer",
  "type": "CONCLUDE",
  "conclusion": "The apartment costs 19.6Cr including GST and maintenance."
}
```

For Middle steps:

```json
{
  "step_index": 1,
  "description": "In last step, I got a long response which I will summarize/filter myself",
  "type": "CODE",
  "code": "result = "YOUR SUMMARIZATION OR FILTERED RESULT OR SEMANTIC ANALYSIS"
}

### Clarification Request

> Must include `"description"` and `"conclusion"`:

```json
{
  "step_index": 0,
  "description": "Query unclear, ask for clarification.",
  "type": "NOP",
  "conclusion": "Could you specify the location or project name you're referring to?"
}
```


### CODE Rules

* Tools mentioned in the example above may not exist. 
* Use ONLY the tools listed below. 
* Strictly use positional arguments, correct: tool("value"); incorrect: tool(argname="value")
* Always **chain aggressively within a step** (don‚Äôt break trivial operations into multiple steps).
* Use this syntax for parallel: `await parallel((tool, arg1), (tool2, arg1, arg2))`
* End every code block with `return`.
* **Do not access variables across steps.**
* If an answer can be derived without tool use, prefer `"CONCLUDE"`.
* For analytical or summarization tasks (e.g., summarizing markdown or extracted text), write:
  "code": "result = """<your actual summary or insight here>"""\nreturn result"
  Replace <your actual summary or insight here> with your real generated analysis based on the input. Make 1000% sre you are not hallucinating here and this is correct informative response.
* You must pass arguments to each tool **exactly as defined** ‚Äî including argument **types** and **count**.
* Do **not assume**, transform, or reinterpret the expected input. For example, if a tool requires a `string`, do not pass a list of characters or vice versa.
* If a tool failed once, do not use it again. 
* Before using any function in `"CODE"`, make sure it is available. If not then use your Analytical mind.

2025-05-16 23:51:41,846 - INFO - perception:run:57 - üîç Perception Prompt: You are the perception module of a reasoning agent. Your job is to interpret either the original user query or the output of a completed step (like a tool execution or a conclusion), and return a structured analysis of what was observed.

There are two modes in which you may be invoked:

### Mode: Initial Query Understanding
(snapshot_type = "user_query")

You are being asked to interpret the **initial user query**. Your job is to:
- Extract the most important entities
- Describe what kind of result is expected (numerical, list, decision, explanation, etc.)
- Determine whether this goal is directly achievable using known tools, memory, or the information already present
- If the answer is already obvious and complete, mark `original_goal_achieved = true` and provide a valid `solution_summary`
- Provide reasoning for both global goal and local observation


### Mode: Step Result Interpretation
(snapshot_type = "step_result")

You are being asked to **evaluate a step result** that was executed as part of the current plan version. You are **not allowed to refer to prior plan versions** ‚Äî only the current plan and the completed steps so far.

You will be provided with:
- The result of the most recent step (text, JSON, or other output)
- A short description of that step
- The current objective
- A few completed prior steps (for context only)
- Memory log of past step failures if memory.

Your job is to:
- Determine what entities were extracted or learned
- Evaluate whether this step helped move closer to the original query‚Äôs goal
- Determine whether this step‚Äôs result fully answers the user query
- If so, mark `original_goal_achieved = true` and write a `solution_summary`
- Otherwise, assess whether the step was locally useful or if more steps are needed
- Provide clear reasoning in both global and local contexts, including names of tools and why they failed.


### Output Format (ERORLL JSON):

Return your result in the following structured format:

```json
{
  "entities": ["..."],             // A list of concrete items, terms, or values identified (e.g., ["Sedan", "Tesla", "$80k"])
  "result_requirement": "...",     // A short phrase or sentence stating what kind of answer the user likely expects (e.g., "List of unit configurations with pricing")
  "original_goal_achieved": false, // true if this single step completely answers the original query; false if more steps are needed
  "confidence": "..."              // A Value between 0 and 1.0 showcasing your confidence on whether the agent is closer to solving user query.  
  "reasoning": "...",              // A global explanation: Does this result move the agent closer to solving the user query? Why or why not?
  "local_goal_achieved": false,    // true if this step *locally* succeeded (e.g., extracted useful data) and will help achieve final goal, even if the final goal isn't met yet
  "local_reasoning": "..."         // A focused explanation of what this step contributed: was it a valid lookup, good chunk match, or meaningful transform or whether previous tool failed and why?
  "last_tooluse_summary: "..."     // ToolName and whether success or failure reason.
  "solution_summary": "..."        // Your user friendly and readable summary of the solution only if "original_goal_achieved" is True, else "Not ready yet".
}

```

Use booleans only for `original_goal_achieved` and `local_goal_achieved`.
Think deeply before you fill in the reasoning. Your output will guide whether future steps are needed, retried, or skipped.
Keep descriptions short. Keep output tight and purpose-driven. 
If you see that in past a tool has failed, recommend not to use that tool anymore! VERY IMPORTANT to provide the NAME of the tool that failed.
If you can just summarize or perform a job at which you're really good, and finish the job, then just do it! Do not wait for next steps. 
Do not return explanations or markdown outside the ERORLL JSON. No additional explanation is needed.
