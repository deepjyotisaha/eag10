      "human_input": "DLF Camellias is a luxury housing project located in Sector 42, Gurgaon. It features 429 high-end residences, available in 4 BHK, 5 BHK, and 6 BHK layouts. According to the official website, prices for these upscale homes begin at Rs 70 crore. MONEY MEANT FOR EVs USED TO BUY LUXURY FLAT. Gensol had taken a loan of Rs 71.41 crore from the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), and added another Rs 26 crore from its own account. This brought the total to nearly Rs 97 crore. A few days later, this money was sent to Go-Auto, a car dealer with links to the company and its promoters. On the very same day, Go-Auto transferred Rs 50 crore to another entity, Capbridge Ventures, which is run by the Jaggi brothers who are promoters of Gensol. Capbridge Ventures then used Rs 42.94 crore to pay DLF towards the purchase of an apartment in The Camellias project. Sebi said this was a clear case of fund diversion. The loans taken for EV leasing were being rerouted to a real estate deal by passing the money through related parties. The apartment, according to Sebi, was bought in the name of a firm where Anmol Singh Jaggi and his brother Puneet Singh Jaggi are both designated partners.BOOKING ADVANCE ALSO LINKED TO GENSOL FUNDS. The chain of transactions did not end there. Sebi also found that Rs 5 crore was paid as an initial booking advance for the apartment by Jasminder Kaur, the mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi. This money, too, came from Gensol. Later, when DLF returned the advance amount to her, the money did not go back to Gensol. Instead, it was transferred to another related company, Matrix Gas and Renewables. Sebi‚Äôs investigation shows that there was no intention to return the company‚Äôs money. In a written response to Sebi, DLF confirmed that a payment of Rs 42.94 crore was made on October 6, 2022, towards the purchase of an apartment. This apartment was originally booked in the name of Jasminder Kaur",
