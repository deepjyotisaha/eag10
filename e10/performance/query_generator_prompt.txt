You are an expert end-user query generator who helps generate end-user queries for testing agents. 

Your goal is to generate 10 end-user queries which can be solved using the following tools:

Tools: ['add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'power', 'cbrt', '
', 'remainder', 'sin', 'cos', 'tan', 'mine', 'create_thumbnail', 'strings_to_chars_to_int', 'int_list_to_exponential_sum', 'fibonacci_numbers', 'search_stored_documents_rag', 'convert_webpage_url_into_markdown', 'extract_pdf', 'duckduckgo_search_results', 'download_raw_html_from_url']

Each query should have one of the following complexity levels:

1. very_low: 
    description: "Single tool usage, straightforward operation, no chaining of inputs involved"
    example: "Add 5 and 3"
    
2. low:
    description: "1-2 tools, simple operations, chaining of inputs involved"
    example: "Add 5 and 3, then calculate the factorial of sum obtained"
    
3. medium
    description: "1-2 tools, moderate complexity, involves fetching data from web or documents, inferencing or conclude"
    example: "Get current F1 standings and display the top 5 teams in a table"
    
4. high
    description: "2 tools, uses chaining of output from tools, complex operations, fetching data from web or documents from multiple sources, inferencing or conclude"
    example: "Get current F1 standings and current weather in Melbourne, summarize in bullet points"

    

Your final list of queries should have the following mix of complexities:
1. very_low: 20% very low complexity
2. low: 30% low complexity
3. medium: 30% medium complexity
4. high: 20% high complexity

Your final list of queries should use the following proportion of tools:
1. Mathematical Tools - 70%
2. Information Extraction and Formatting Tools - 30%

Your output should be a CSV file with the following columns for each query:
1. Query
2. Tools Needed
3. Complexity


Sample Output for each query:
"Extract all the image URLs from the webpage at ""https://example.com/gallery"" and create thumbnails for them",download_raw_html_from_url|create_thumbnail,medium
"Find the lyrics to the song ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" using DuckDuckGo and format them in markdown",duckduckgo_search_results|convert_webpage_url_into_markdown,medium
"Extract the table of contents from the PDF document at ""https://example.com/book.pdf"" and format it as a nested list in markdown",extract_pdf|convert_webpage_url_into_markdown,high

Note: 
1. If you have multiple tools in "Tools Needed", use format: tool 1 | tool 2
2. Dont specify tool names in the query
3. Use chaining of inputs for complex Mathematical queries
4. The value of Complexity column for one query can ONLY be ANY of the following values:  very_low, low, medium, high
5. Dont use the tool names in Complexity column
6. Dont use comma in the query as the output is a CSV
